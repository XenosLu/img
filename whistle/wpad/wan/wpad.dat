WARNINGS, INFORMATION, AND ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION
 *************************************************************************************
It is highly recommended that you keep this documentation block if you modify
this file.

DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT log into web portals where financial or personal
information is at risk using an anonymous/3rd party proxy. It is possible that
an anonymous proxy is set up to record all traffic and to mine usernames and
passwords for websites. Monitoring insecure authentication or cookies are just a
few of many methods to achieve this. I have set up some rules which will help
minimize the effect of this but it is still recommended to disable this proxy
whenever handling such information. This is not a flaw of this software or
wpad.dat but more the nature of an anonymous proxy.

Public Proxies and the Law
According to U.S. law, 18 U.S.C. Section 1030 (Fraud and Related Activity in
Connection with Computers) applies only when anyone who knowingly accesses a
computer without authorization or has knowingly exceeds his authorized access on
that computer. Because an opened proxy, by default, allows connections and use of
the service by anyone in the WWW, its administrator has essentially authorized
everyone to use the proxy. Therefore browsing the web, via anonymous proxies, is
not illegal.


This software is geared towards advanced end users and security professionals. By
using this software you agree to the MIT license which governs any unlicensed
software or files related to this file.


What is wpad.dat?
wpad.dat is a Web Proxy Automatic Detection (WPAD) file. Your browser selects a
proxy based on the pre-defined rules specified in the wpad.dat file. The language
is JavaScript for wpad.dat.


Pros/Cons of proxying using my wpad.dat method?
Pros:
 * Your IP address is constantly changing from the perspective of the web
server making you impossible to track.
 * There are pre-defined rules which help to protect your information if you
accidently forget to turn off this proxy method while browsing websites
where financial or personal information are at risk.
 * If a website is using an encrypted connection then it does not go through
any anonymous proxy.  PLEASE NOTE if you opt out of my predefined rules
then this is no longer the case.

Cons:
 * Your browsing speed is slightly diminished because you are visiting
websites via a proxy.
 * Your browsing habits and information are not guarunteed to be protected
from the anonymous proxy if by some happance this file is misconfigured.
